# Hi, I'm Stefan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Steward and Research Software Engineer at Tilburg University. I help researchers to professionalize their digital workflows. This includes:
- Offering advice on good practices
- Writing software based on specifications, either by myself or in collaboration with researchers
- Developing and providing training programs and digital resources that empower researchers to work according to good practices themselves

Through my work, I aim to foster Open Science by promoting FAIR data and software practices, enhancing reproducibility, and improving the digital literacy of researchers of all career stages.

## Consultancy and Policy Projects

### Advisor & Technical Trainer in NWO Vici Grant
I provide advice on good practices regarding the development of [FAIR](https://fair-software.nl/) and sustainable software. In addition to advising on good practices, I provide coaching and training tailored to the experience levels of the involved researchers, most of whom are early in their careers.

### Research Infrastructure Program Tilburg
The RI program aims to modernize Tilburg University's research infrastructure, enabling its academic staff to conduct state-of-the-art research. I am involved in several of the [program's six focus areas]((https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/research-infrastructure-programma-op-stoom)) and I'm a core team member in two areas.
- **Research Community and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**:
I am part of the team  for the subproject "Open Science Trainings" subproject by curating content for Open Science Meetups. I also advise on content for trainings on the use of AI within research, which are organized within this line.
- **Artificial Intelligence as a Research Tool**:
This recently added area is all about offering researchers both the technical possibilities, but also the skills to use cutting-edge AI tools to augment their research, while respecting principles of research integrity, compliance and ethical use. As a core team, we navigate the challenges of this rapidly evolving and emerging technology. This involves navigating uncertainties regarding policy technology, privacy, information security, Open Science and FAIR research and training. We are currently converting the formal guidelines into easy-to-understand checklists and examples for use cases and potential dilemmas researchers might be facing in the future.

## Training, Course and Community Development

### R Courses for Social (and other) Scientists
- **R Beginner Course**
- **R Intermediate Courses**  
I led the curriculum development in collaboration with a team of educators. Where possible, we based our materials on Data Carpentry and other existing open-source resources.

### Head of CAFE Community Tilburg & eScienceCenter Fellow
In 2024, with the help of the [eScienceCenter Fellowship grant](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/), I founded Tilburg's [CAFE](https://code-cafes-nl.github.io/cafe_playbook/) community. The community centers around a meetup series called Coding CafÃ©s, which bring together researchers from various disciplines to foster learning and experience-sharing about research software. Together with engineers and the coordinator at the eScienceCenter, I develop the curriculum for the invited speaker sessions.

### Open Science Trainings & Curriculum Development


### Games of Horror for Open Science Training (aka the [GHOST collective](https://ghostcollective.github.io/))
- Together with an amazing team of motivated support staff from several Dutch institutions, we develop online and physical games that follow a different than normal route for teaching Open Science. By gamifying the experience, we aim to make the content less intimidating by engaging learners in a playful way.

## Digital Platforms and Resources

### Research Support and Web Portal of Tilburg University
I was involved in defining the structure and collaboration channels within our growing Research Data and Software Support Network. I was also part of the web team that was in charge of a past version of the Research Support Portal website, which presents the following information to researchers:
- The structure of the universityâ€™s Research Data and Software Support Network.
- The services offered by the network and the types of support available.
- Who to contact for which type of question.

### Tilburg Science Hub & Tilburg.ai
[Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/) is a crowdsourced knowledge base for researchers, students and educators to learn about state-of-the-art Open and Digital Science techniques. Its spin-off [Tilburg.ai](https://tilburg.ai/) covers the latest developments, techniques, and applications of AI in academia. I contributed and collaborated on the following articles:
  - [SPSS Data in R](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/manage-manipulate/loading/getting-started/spss-files-in-r/)
  - [Note-Taking Systems in Academia](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/Research-skills/Organization/note-taking/pkms-in-academia/)
  - [Introduction to AI Safety and AI Alignment](https://tilburg.ai/2025/01/ai-safety/)
